## About Me

I recently earned a master's degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. 
My studies focused on transport operations and services, data analytics and the application of AI in transport, including machine learning and model training tailored to transport data. I am particularly interested in using transport data analysis to assist traffic planners in decision making,managing disruptions in multimodal systems, and enhancing service operational design. I am passionated about promoting sustainable public and road transport while ensuring high quality and cost-efficient operations. 

I excel in project-based work, having collaborated with my peers at KTH on various projects to address real-world challenges. My background in civil engineering has strenghened my skills in logical thinking and problem-solving. I have honed skills in cross-sector collaboration,
developing methodologies, and effectively communicating solutions to stakeholders.

Living in Sweden allowed me to explore public transport systems across Europe, inspiring my commitment to a more sustainable transport future.
