## About Me

I am a civil engineer with five years experience, and I recently earned an M.Sc. in Transport and Geoinformation Technology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. 
My strong background in civil engineering has equipped me with skills in problem-solving, systematic thinking, and critical analysis.

My interests include transport data analysis, AI and machine learning applications in transport, traffic planning, services, and operations. I am passionate about promoting public and road transport, improving systems and accessibility, and advancing transport equity.

Living in Sweden allowed me to explore public transport systems across Europe, deepening my understanding of how cities function and inspiring my commitment to a sustainable, equitable, and safer transport future.
