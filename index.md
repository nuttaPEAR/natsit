## About me

I recently earned a master’s degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. My studies focused on solving real-world challenges in transport and urban mobility projects. For example, transport service and operations, transport data analytics, transport policy, and the application of AI in transport (machine learning and model training). 

I am particularly interested in transport and urban mobility, such as leveraging transport data analysis to assist traffic planners in decision-making processes related to urban mobility and land use. I am also passionate about managing disruptions in multimodal transport systems and enhancing service and operational design to better serve residents. My ultimate goal is to promote sustainable cities with efficient public and road transport systems, and beyond.

I excel in project-based work, having collaborated with my peers at KTH on various projects to address real-world challenges. My background in civil engineering has strengthened my skills in logical thinking, problem-solving, and technical expertise. Additionally, I have developed skills in cross-sector collaboration, developing methodologies, and effectively communicating solutions to stakeholders.

Living in Sweden allowed me to explore public transport systems across Europe, inspiring my commitment to a more sustainable transport future.
