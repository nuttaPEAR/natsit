## About me

Enthusiastic and driven graduate with a Master’s degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology from Stockholm, Sweden, with demonstrated expertise in transport data analytics, particularly in assessing the impact of disruptions on passenger travel patterns. Equipped with a strong background in civil engineering and experience in infrastructure and project management, I bring proven problem-solving skills and a collaborative mindset to multidisciplinary teams. 

I am interested in transport and urban planning, with a motivation to contribute to the development of sustainable, safe, and efficient cities through smarter transport systems and resilient infrastructure.
